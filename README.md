# GoBoard
A common game of Go.

This is for a class assignment for CSCI 152 for the Uniersity of Montana. In this program, there will be a game of go, with a board, capturing, and scoring. 

Assignment requires scoring and capturing as well as using recursion for one of those 2 functions.

How to play (From the British Go Association https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html):

A game of Go starts with an empty board. Each player has an effectively unlimited supply of pieces (called stones), one taking the black stones, the other taking white. The main object of the game is to use your stones to form territories by surrounding vacant areas of the board. It is also possible to capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them.

Players take turns, placing one of their stones on a vacant point at each turn, with Black playing first. Note that stones are placed on the intersections of the lines rather than in the squares and once played stones are not moved. However they may be captured, in which case they are removed from the board, and kept by the capturing player as prisoners. 

At the end of the game, the players count one point for each vacant point inside their own territory, and one point for every stone they have captured. The player with the larger total of territory plus prisoners is the winner.
